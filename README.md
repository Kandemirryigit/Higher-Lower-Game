-Final screen looks like this.We can just run this program in the terminal and I created a user interface to use this program eaisly in the terminal.I used logos.I used https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Ogre&t= this website to create all logos.I always used print("\n") to use a fresh screen.In my opinion print("\n) method is perfect to create a fresh screen.It just writes empty lines in the terminal so we can see a fresh and a brandnew screen.




HOW CAN I PLAY THE GAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should play the game with your friend.The game is for two person.You can't play the game alone.Firstly the game is going to ask you and your partner's name.First you after your partner gonna give answer to the questions.you should try to guess which fotbaal player has more follower on instagram.If you guess the question true in your round you are going to win a point.And the system is same to your partner too.After 3 point if (your score - your partner's score=2) or your (partner's score - your score=2) the game is over.If your score greather than your partner you win else your partner win.And the game is going to ask you do you wanna restart the game if you choose yes you are going to turn the start of the game else the game is going to turn off.




HOW CAN I PLAY EXCEPT FOTBAAL PLAYERS?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I chose to play this game with fotbaal players.The program is going to give you two fotbaal players' name,team and country informations and you are going to try guessing fotbaal players' instagram follower count.In my opinion if you are familiar with fotbaal the game is going to bee soo easy to you.But if you are not the game can be so complicated.But if you want you can edit characters file and you can add what you want.But don't forget if you edit key informations the code is not gonna work so you can just edit values.If you just edit values the code is going to run properly.
